OCaml library for semi-Markov conditional random fields

Semi-Markov conditional random fields (SMCRFs) are a type of probabilistic graphical model used to
produce segmentations of sequential data, such as gene finding in DNA sequences or named-entity
recognition in natural language text. SMCRFs are a discriminative generalization of hidden Markov
models and hidden semi-Markov models. This OCaml library provides a generic infrastructure for
building SMCRFs, estimating their parameters based on training data, and applying them to segment
new examples of interest.

Status: the code is pretty stable, but there is no tutorial documentation yet, which is sorely
needed for a complex topic like this. Working on it.

Requires: GNU Scientific Library, ocamlgsl and ocaml+twt
